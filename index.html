  <p>Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee. They were formed in 2004 by Hayley William, brothers Josh and Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. They named the band after the maiden name of one of their bass players. After learning that paramour means secret lovers, they decided to keep it and adopt the Paramore spelling. The band has five studio albums and current members include Hayley Williams, Zac Farro, and Taylor York. Their music inlcudes loud instruments and loud vocals that harmonize together. The female vocals provide a different take on rock. They also use a lot of alternative pop-punk influences that make their music relatable.</p>
